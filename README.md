In this assignment, we will implement our own convolutional neural network, first in NumPy and then in PyTorch.

Before starting the assignment:

Run the file download_data.sh to download the data we will use for training.
Install all the necessary libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt (if you haven't worked with pip before, visit here - https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/).
